       "(0:56) (Black Bose QuietComfort headphones are shown - text overlay: Bose QuietComfort)\n",
       "(1:02) The Headphones 700 had some metal parts, but the QC Ultra Headphones incorporate an aluminum yoke and arms that slide into the headband.\n",
       "(1:03) (Close-up of the white QC Ultra showing the aluminum yoke)\n",
       "(1:08) (Man demonstrates adjusting the headband)\n",
       "(1:11) Another upgrade is their dual-hinged design, so they both fold up and fold flat.\n",
       "(1:14) (Man demonstrates folding the headphones flat)\n",
       "(1:16) Just be careful not to get your finger caught in the hinge, which I did a couple of times and got an unpleasant pinch.\n",
       "(1:19) (Man demonstrates the folding hinge near his fingers)\n",
       "(1:22) The headphones feel durable and are surprisingly lightweight at 254 grams, which is just a couple of grams more than what the Headphones 700 weigh.\n",
       "(1:22) (White QC Ultra headphones are placed on a digital scale - text overlay: 254g Bose QuietComfort Ultra)\n",

       "(1:47) (Man walks in a subway station wearing white QC Ultra headphones)\n",
       "(1:51) Like other over-ear headphones, they will steam up your ears if you wear them around in warmer environments.\n",
       "(1:52) (Man sits on a couch with white QC Ultra headphones and adjusts them)\n",
       "(1:55) It's also worth mentioning that the black version of the headphones can end up showing some smudges if you have any grime on your hands or just have oily skin.\n",
       "(1:56) (Side-by-side shot of white and black QC Ultra headphones)\n",
       "(2:03) The white smoke version doesn't.\n",

       "\n",
       "(2:05) (Header: FEATURES)\n",
       "(2:05) I did like the controls. The QC Ultra Headphones feature a mix of physical control buttons along with a raised volume strip on the right ear cup that's easy to reach and use by feel alone.\n",

       "(2:12) (Man touches the volume strip on the white headphones)\n",

       "(2:20) You can choose to map it to one of four functions.\n",

       "(2:42) The Awareness mode is equivalent to Apple's Transparency mode, and it sounds quite natural with almost no audible hiss.\n",
       "(2:43) (Man sits on a park bench wearing black QC Ultra headphones)\n",
       "(2:49) There's also a new ActiveSense feature that kicks in some noise canceling should the sound get too loud around you.\n",
       "(2:49) (Shot of phone screen showing Aware mode with ActiveSense toggle on)\n",
       "(2:54) That's similar to the new Adaptive Audio feature on the AirPods Pro 2.\n",
       "(2:55) (Shot of iPhone screen showing AirPods Pro settings: Noise Control Adaptive, Conversation Awareness On, Spatial Audio Not Playing)\n",
       "(2:59) That feature isn't available for the AirPods Max because it requires Apple's H2 chip.\n",

       "(3:15) (Black QC Ultra headphones are shown resting on a surface)\n",
       "(3:19) If they aren't used within a certain amount of time, you can actually set the time anywhere from 5 minutes to 24 hours, they will completely turn off on their own.\n",

       "## Immersive Audio\n",
       "\n",
       "(3:31) While Bose mentions that both this over-ear Ultra model and its new QC Ultra Earbuds feature world-class noise cancellation, and they certainly do, the real feature it's hyping this go around is Immersive Audio.\n",
       "(3:32) (QC Ultra earbuds are shown on their charging case)\n",
       "(3:38) It's a custom version of a spatial audio.\n",
       "(3:40) Bose says that immersive audio goes beyond special effects and creates a wider, more spacious soundstage, so your content becomes multi-dimensional and layered regardless of the audio platform or device.\n",
       "(3:44) (Man sits outside with white QC Ultra headphones, looking at his phone)\n",
       "(3:55) Like other headphones that feature spatial audio, Apple's latest AirPods for instance, the QC Ultra Headphones and QC Ultra Earbuds have two spatial audio modes: one Still mode without head tracking engaged, and a Motion mode that uses head tracking and allows the audio to move with you so it's always in front of you.\n",
       "(4:00) (Shot of the phone screen showing Immersive Audio settings: Off, Still, Motion)\n",

       "(4:12) (Man taps the play button on the Spotify app)\n",
       "(4:13) Bose says it works with movies and any stereo track, but it's really designed for music listening.\n",
       "(4:18) Using the immersive audio feature does widen the sound stage a bit, creating the illusion that your audio is more outside your head.\n",
       "(4:24) It works better with some tracks than others, but it does open up the sound a bit, giving it an airier quality.\n",
       "(4:31) Most people will probably choose to leave it on, but the downside is that engaging it does impact battery life significantly.\n",

       "(4:46) (Header: Sound Quality)\n",
       "(4:47) I spent some time comparing the sound quality of the QC Ultra Headphones to that of the Sony WH-1000XM5 and the AirPods Max.\n",
       "(4:54) (Close-up of the silver accents and vents on the white headphones)\n",
       "(4:55) While the QC Ultra Headphones have the same drivers as the Headphones 700, the Ultra sound has improved.\n",
       "(4:59) It's not a huge improvement, but the Ultras seem slightly cleaner sounding and more revealing, with deeper but well-defined bass.\n",
       "(5:06) (Man puts on white QC Ultra headphones and walks outside)\n",
       "(5:08) Since they feature the same drivers, most of the audio quality gains come from the more powerful chipset with improved digital processing.\n",
       "(5:15) Both the Sony XM5 and AirPods Max are excellent sounding headphones, and sound quality is subjective, as everybody has different ears and different musical tastes.\n",
       "(5:15) (Man walks outside wearing Sony WH-1000XM5 - text overlay: Sony WH-1000XM5)\n",

       "(5:23) (Man holding white QC Ultra headphones showing the ear cups with 'R' and 'L' text)\n",
       "(5:25) But I say this Bose is a touch ahead of both the Sony and AirPods Max for sound quality.\n",
       "(5:29) The Sony has a slightly warmer sound profile, and the Bose just comes across as slightly more natural sounding than the AirPods Max.\n",
       "(5:32) (Man on subway wearing white QC Ultra headphones - text overlay: Bose QuietComfort Ultra)\n",
       "(5:36) By that, I mean it sounds slightly more accurate.\n",
       "(5:38) All that said, I was slightly disappointed the headphones don't feature USB-C audio.\n",
       "(5:41) (Man holds the headphone cable in the case)\n",
       "(5:42) You get a headphone cable for wired listening, which will come in handy for air travel.\n",
       "(5:46) But with most smartphones now missing a headphone jack, it'd be nice to be able to plug a USB-C cable directly into your phone and have an all-digital wired connection or lossless audio track.\n",
       "(5:55) The Beats Studio Pro and some other headphones offer that feature.\n",
       "(5:56) (Beats Studio Pro headphones plugged into a laptop via USB-C - text overlay: Beats Studio Pro CNET)\n",
       "(6:00) I have one other small gripe.\n",
       "(6:01) Bose says that both the QC Ultra Earbuds and QC Ultra Headphones feature the Snapdragon Sound technology suite enabling support for the latest Qualcomm aptX Adaptive codec for audio streaming, including lossless and low latency capabilities.\n",
       "(6:14) Google Fast Pair is also on board.\n",
       "(6:16) But you may have problems actually getting AptX to work with your device.\n",
       "(6:21) I paired the headphones with a Google Pixel 7, which supports AptX audio, but it defaulted to the AAC audio codec for HD audio even after I accessed the developer mode.\n",

       "(6:34) When I paired them with a Samsung Galaxy Flip 5, which is supposed to be Snapdragon Sound enabled, the same thing happened.\n",
       "(6:37) However, when I connected them to an ASUS ROG Phone 6, another Snapdragon enabled phone, I was able to use AptX Adaptive.\n",
       "(6:44) I found the whole thing a little bit irritating, and I do think there'll be some confusion around the AptX support.\n",

       "\n",
       "(6:51) I had better luck with multipoint pairing.\n",
       "(6:53) While the QC Ultra Earbuds still lack multipoint, which allows you to connect to two devices simultaneously and switch audio between them, the Ultra Headphones have it.\n",

       "(7:09) I'll finish by talking about the noise canceling and voice calling performance.\n",
       "(7:11) As I said, Bose isn't talking up the noise canceling as much as it usually does.\n",
       "(7:14) (Man wearing white QC Ultra headphones walks on a street)\n",
       "(7:17) Maybe that's because it's as good as it is and speaks for itself.\n",

       "(7:26) (Man continues walking on the street)\n",
       "(7:26) But I wore these in the noisy streets of New York, and the headphones really muffled everything around me, including people's voices.\n",
       "(7:32) It's top-notch.\n",
       "(7:33) Voice calling performance is also excellent. I was told they have five microphones in each ear cup, four external and one inside the ear cup, that help drive both the noise canceling and voice calling performance.\n",
       "(7:37) (Close-up of vents/mics on the black headphones)\n",
       "(7:44) While I was slightly disappointed with how much background noise the QC Ultra Earbuds let in...\n",

       "(8:16) (On-screen text: John Falcone Senior Director of Content CNET)\n",
       "(8:16) So, from the listener's point of view, this sounds very good. Your voice is nice and clear and I don't really hear much background noise whatsoever.\n",

       "(8:39) (Header: Like)\n",
       "(8:40) What I like: they're lightweight and comfortable and their new design is an upgrade over Bose's Headphones 700 and the standard Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones.\n",
       "(8:41) (On-screen text: 👍 Upgrade on old design)\n",
       "(8:44) They sound excellent, the new Immersive Audio mode does offer some sound quality enhancements.\n",

       "(8:57) (Header: Dislike)\n",
       "(8:58) What I don't like: their higher price tag. They're $30 more than the Sony, which is already seeing meaningful discounts.\n",
       "(8:59) (On-screen text: 👎 Higher price)\n",
       "(9:01) They don't have USB-C audio.\n",
       "(9:02) (On-screen text: 👎 No USB-C Audio)\n",
       "(9:04) Also, engaging immersive audio impacts battery life, which already isn't quite as good as what you get with some noise canceling headphones.\n",
       "(9:13) And lastly, their support for the AptX Audio codec seems limited.\n",
       "(9:15) (On-screen text: 👎 Limited AptX Support)\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "(9:18) Despite those small downsides, if you can afford their higher price tag, and hopefully, they will go on sale at some point, I do think they are very worthy alternatives to both the Sony XM5s and the AirPods Max.\n",
