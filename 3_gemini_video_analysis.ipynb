       "**Video Title:** Sony WF-1000XM5 After 6 Months: Worth It?\n",
       "**Channel:** 6 Months Later\n",
       "**Reviewer:** Josh Teder\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Intro\n",
       "\n",
       "(0:00) [Background music begins: upbeat, slightly electronic]\n",
       "(0:00) [Visual: Medium shot of Josh Teder from the side, wearing the black Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. He is standing inside a structure with vertical LED lights changing color (blue, green, red, purple).]\n",
       "(0:00) **Josh Teder:** It's been six months since I bought the latest premium buds from Sony, the WF-1000XM5s, and 245 listening hours later, I've got some thoughts.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Sound Quality\n",
       "\n",
       "(0:10) [Visual: Close-up of Josh's head from the side, lights changing from blue to red to green.]\n",
       "(0:10) **Josh Teder:** The first thing that stands out with these buds is their sound.\n",
       "(0:14) [Visual: Top-down shot of a wooden surface. Two open black charging cases for the Sony earbuds are shown. The one on the right is slightly larger.]\n",
       "(0:14) **Josh Teder:** They're pretty similar to the excellent sound we got with the previous XM4s, with excellent clarity, bass, mids, and a pretty wide sound stage for earbuds and good separation.\n",
       "(0:15) [On-screen text appears: \"All products seen in this video were purchased by 6 Months Later. Sony has no relationship with the channel. This video has no sponsor.\"]\n",
       "(0:24) **Josh Teder:** They're the closest I've been able to get to an over-the-ear headphone experience in a pair of earbuds.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Noise Cancellation\n",
       "\n",
       "(0:24) [Visual: Josh is now in an office/desk setting. There is a large monitor and a light bar behind him, casting blue and yellow light. He is holding the right earbud in his left hand and putting the left earbud in his left ear.]\n",
       "(0:24) **Josh Teder:** Now, the thing that you notice even more from the XM4s with these XM5s is their noise cancellation.\n",
       "(0:39) [Visual: Josh is back outside at night, looking up slightly, standing inside the blue LED ring.]\n",
       "(0:39) **Josh Teder:** It is noticeably a bit better. It's great for when I'm walking around town, cooking, and yes, it's excellent for plane rides.\n",
       "(0:43) [Visual: Overhead shot of hands tossing salad in a metal bowl with tongs. Josh is wearing the earbuds.]\n",
       "(0:45) [Visual: Side shot of Josh in the kitchen, wearing the left earbud, looking down at the salad.]\n",
       "(0:47) [Visual: Josh is outside again, within the colorful LED structure, looking to the side as the lights change.]\n",
       "(0:47) **Josh Teder:** The noise cancellation on these is pretty comparable to the noise cancellation on a pair of Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones, which I've also reviewed.\n",
       "(0:50) [Visual: Top-down shot of the wooden surface. The black earbud case is open on the right. A pair of black Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are placed next to it on the left.]\n",
       "(0:56) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, talking to the camera.]\n",
       "(0:56) **Josh Teder:** One part of the noise cancellation experience on these buds that has significantly been improved is wind noise.\n",
       "(1:01) [Visual: Night shot outdoors. Josh is walking on a bridge/path, wearing the earbuds and a scarf. Street lights and buildings are visible in the background.]\n",
       "(1:01) **Josh Teder:** When you're out on a very windy day and you do get some wind noise, its volume is less than what I experienced with the XM4s.\n",
       "(1:07) [Visual: Josh is back inside the colorful LED structure at night, looking at the camera, slightly squinting.]\n",
       "(1:09) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting. He gestures with his right hand and touches his ear.]\n",
       "(1:10) **Josh Teder:** And what makes the noise cancellation and sound with these buds even more impressive is their overall comfort.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comfort & Fit\n",
       "\n",
       "(1:16) [Visual: White retail box for Apple AirPods Pro is shown on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(1:16) **Josh Teder:** Unlike other earbuds like the AirPods Pro, for example, that are a bit bulbous with the plastic part of the earbud that sticks into your ear.\n",
       "(1:18) [Visual: Hand opens the AirPods Pro case and takes out one earbud.]\n",
       "(1:24) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting. He is holding the right Sony earbud between his thumb and index finger.]\n",
       "(1:24) **Josh Teder:** The only part of these buds that go into your ear are the excellent foam tips that Sony designed.\n",
       "(1:30) [Visual: Josh touches the left earbud in his ear, demonstrating where the foam tip goes.]\n",
       "(1:30) **Josh Teder:** The foam material is I would say even a bit softer than it was on the XM4s, and overall comfort is just excellent.\n",
       "(1:38) [Visual: Josh leans back slightly, looking comfortable.]\n",
       "(1:38) **Josh Teder:** I can wear these buds for hours without feeling any discomfort.\n",
       "(1:41) [Visual: White box containing various ear tip sizes (XS, S, M, L) in different colors and a charging cable.]\n",
       "(1:41) **Josh Teder:** The bud comes with four tip sizes, and the app will walk you through a test to see which one will fit you the best.\n",
       "(1:45) [Visual: A hand holds an iPhone showing the Sony Headphones Connect app. The screen displays \"Test wearing condition\" and an animation of an ear with the earbud being tested for air-tightness.]\n",
       "(1:49) [Visual: A hand picks up one of the Sony earbuds from the black charging case.]\n",
       "(1:49) **Josh Teder:** The only small thing with their design I haven't liked is the polished plastic material. It can be a bit slippery when you take the buds out of the case.\n",
       "(1:52) [Visual: The hand drops the earbud onto the wooden surface and it spins slightly before stopping.]\n",
       "(1:53) [Visual: The hand picks up the earbud.]\n",
       "(1:55) [Visual: Close-up of two Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds side-by-side on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(1:57) **Josh Teder:** The earbud shape is also slimmer compared to the XM4s.\n",
       "(1:59) [Visual: Hand holds two Sony earbuds. The hand on the right holds the earbud with the foam tip, showing the mesh.]\n",
       "(1:59) **Josh Teder:** They stick out of your ears less and the foam tips now include this mesh part to help protect ear gunk from messing up part of the speaker.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Sleeping Comfort\n",
       "\n",
       "(2:09) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, holding the right earbud and shrugging.]\n",
       "(2:09) **Josh Teder:** Now, can you sleep with them in?\n",
       "(2:11) [Visual: Josh puts the earbud in his ear and smiles, then makes a face indicating discomfort.]\n",
       "(2:11) **Josh Teder:** Overall, I'd say no. That's one, not really their design intention, but two, even though they are slimmer than the previous version, they still stick out of your ears a little bit where you may accidentally hit them in the night, turn on and off noise cancellation, and that could disrupt your sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Ozlo Sleepbuds Mention\n",
       "\n",
       "(2:26) [Visual: Josh talks to the camera.]\n",
       "(2:26) **Josh Teder:** I am, however, planning to review the new Ozlo Sleepbuds, which are a pair of buds designed specifically for that purpose, and if you want to see my early impressions and review of those buds, make sure you're subscribed to the channel.\n",
       "(2:27) [Visual: Screen displays \"Ozlo. Designed for sleep.\" with an illustration showing the comfort zone of the ear and the design of the Sleepbuds. Text labels point to \"Comfort Zone\", \"Silicone wing-tip keeps Sleepbud in place\", \"Tiny design sits flush with ear\", \"Soft silicone cup fits comfortably in ear\", \"Sticks out putting pressure on ear canal\", \"Stem can cause earbud to fall out\".]\n",
       "(2:37) [On-screen text appears: \"6 Months Later\", Red button with \"SUBSCRIBE\", Calendar icon with \"6\"]\n",
       "\n",
       "## Battery Life\n",
       "\n",
       "(2:39) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, holding the open charging case in his hand.]\n",
       "(2:39) **Josh Teder:** Next up, let's talk battery life.\n",
       "(2:40) [Visual: Top-down shot of the open black Sony earbud case with the earbuds inside, on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(2:40) **Josh Teder:** It's great with the buds themselves. They're rated for eight hours of battery with noise cancellation on.\n",
       "(2:43) [On-screen text appears: \"8 hours (With ANC)\"]\n",
       "(2:46) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, holding the open case.]\n",
       "(2:46) **Josh Teder:** And given how much I use these throughout the day, I've never actually run out of battery, even on a long plane flight, though I don't think I've ever hit like the actual eight hour mark of continuous listening either though.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Charging & Case Features\n",
       "\n",
       "(2:57) [Visual: Hands holding the closed black Sony earbud case. A USB-C cable is inserted into the port on the case.]\n",
       "(2:57) **Josh Teder:** The only part of their battery life I'd consider to be a slight downside is I do find I'm having to charge their case more often compared to my experience with the XM4s.\n",
       "(3:05) [Visual: Two black Sony earbud cases are side-by-side on the wooden surface. The XM5 case (left) is smaller than the XM4 case (right).]\n",
       "(3:05) **Josh Teder:** The case design is much slimmer than the XM4s, but it's still rated to hold 16 hours of battery, so, I'm not quite sure what's going on there.\n",
       "(3:13) [On-screen text appears below the cases: \"16 hours (in case)\"]\n",
       "(3:16) [Visual: Hand holding the closed black Sony earbud case, pointing to the USB-C port and a small button next to it.]\n",
       "(3:16) **Josh Teder:** You can charge the buds via USBC or Chi charging, and the new case also has a Bluetooth pairing button as well.\n",
       "(3:21) [Visual: Hand opens the case, showing a blue LED light inside.]\n",
       "\n",
       "## Controls\n",
       "\n",
       "(3:24) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, talking and gesturing.]\n",
       "(3:24) **Josh Teder:** Now, the controls of these buds are what you'd expect for playback. You've got a single tap for play, pause. You have a double tap to skip forward, triple tap to skip back. But now you do also have volume controls as well.\n",
       "(3:37) [Visual: Josh demonstrates touching the left earbud on his face with his right hand.]\n",
       "(3:37) **Josh Teder:** So you can keep tapping the left earbud for volume down, and then keep tapping the right earbud for volume up.\n",
       "(3:44) [Visual: Transition to a shot of Josh wearing the earbuds and large over-ear headphones around his neck. He touches the left earbud.]\n",
       "(3:44) **Josh Teder:** It's not the best volume control method I've seen on a pair of buds, but it's reliable and does get the job done.\n",
       "\n",
       "## App & Features\n",
       "\n",
       "(3:51) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, talking to the camera.]\n",
       "(3:51) **Josh Teder:** The bud's connection over the past few months for me has been solid with a few hiccups here and there.\n",
       "(3:57) [Visual: A hand holds an iPhone showing the Sony Headphones Connect app for the WF-1000XM5. The app shows battery levels (100% for each earbud, 41% for the case). The \"Sound\" tab is selected.]\n",
       "(3:57) **Josh Teder:** Though I do have my buds to prioritize audio quality versus connection in the app, which could be why I've had those rare connection cutouts, especially when I move from one or two rooms away from my phone.\n",
       "(4:09) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, touching his ear.]\n",
       "(4:09) **Josh Teder:** The only other connection issue that has happened from time to time is when I take the buds out of their case and put them in my ears, I notice only one bud actually seems like it's connected to my phone. So then I got to take them out of my ears again, put them back in the case, shut the case, and then take them out and put them in again and then the issue is resolved.\n",
       "(4:27) [Visual: Two open black Sony earbud cases (XM4 and XM5) are side-by-side on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(4:27) **Josh Teder:** Another major thing Sony improved with these buds compared to the previous version is mic quality.\n",
       "(4:33) **Josh Teder:** Here, take a listen.\n",
       "(4:34) [Visual: Josh holds up an iPhone 13 Pro while talking.]\n",
       "(4:34) **Josh Teder:** Right now I'm just recording using the recorder app on my iPhone with these, but so far I no longer get the feedback from people when I'm on the phone with them that they can't understand what I'm saying sometimes,\n",
       "(4:46) [Visual: The iPhone is still visible. On-screen text appears below Josh: \"HOW DOES IT SOUND? COMMENT BELOW\"]\n",
       "(4:46) **Josh Teder:** like I did with the XM4s.\n",
       "(4:48) [Visual: The iPhone and earbud cases are back on the wooden surface. The iPhone shows the Sony Headphones Connect app, now displaying the XM4 model.]\n",
       "(4:49) **Josh Teder:** Now, to change the EQ of these buds, connection preferences, devices you're simultaneously connected to and more settings, you'll use Sony's Headphones app, which overall is pretty good.\n",
       "(4:59) [Visual: The iPhone screen switches to the XM5 model in the app. The \"Sound\" tab is selected. The \"Ambient Sound Control\" section is visible, with options for \"Noise Canceling\", \"Ambient Sound\", and \"Off\". A slider for \"Ambient Sound\" is set to 20.]\n",
       "(5:04) [Visual: The \"Speak-to-Chat\" option is highlighted. Tapping it brings up a modal window: \"Speak-to-Chat. Have a conversation while wearing the headphones by simply starting to talk. Cancel | Experience It\".]\n",
       "(5:10) **Josh Teder:** I don't end up using a lot of Sony's fancier features like Ambient Sound Control where you can set different noise cancellation levels for different tasks or Speak-to-Chat, mainly because if you sing along to your music or you just talk to yourself, it's going to lower the volume of what's playing, which you probably don't want.\n",
       "(5:19) [Visual: The iPhone app screen shows the \"Equalizer\" section with \"CLEAR BASS +3\" selected. Tapping the arrow expands the section to show the EQ graph. Josh taps \"Treble Boost\".]\n",
       "(5:19) **Josh Teder:** And other features like EQ, I'm glad are there, but I found the buds sound pretty good as is.\n",
       "(5:25) [Visual: The iPhone app screen shows the \"Activity\" tab selected. A \"Listening History\" list is shown.]\n",
       "(5:25) **Josh Teder:** I do think it's cool the app can tell me how long I've listened to the buds for and if my listening volume is at an unhealthy level,\n",
       "(5:29) [Visual: The iPhone app screen switches to the \"Log\" tab, showing \"Total Use Time\" of 543 hours and 57 minutes, and a graph of usage over a period.]\n",
       "(5:30) [Visual: The iPhone app screen switches to the \"Safe Listening\" tab, showing \"Listening habits of the last 7 days\" and confirming it's below WHO allowance.]\n",
       "(5:33) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, talking to the camera.]\n",
       "(5:33) **Josh Teder:** but overall, it's not really an app I use because it's not really one you need to go into all of the time.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Repairability / Ecosystem Integration\n",
       "\n",
       "(5:39) [Visual: Josh holds the closed black Sony earbud case.]\n",
       "(5:39) **Josh Teder:** Now, one of the biggest downsides going with these buds, especially if you're an Apple user, is they don't really integrate well into the Apple ecosystem.\n",
       "(5:47) [Visual: A large TV screen shows a hand holding and manipulating an Apple Watch strap. A person is wearing AirPods Max headphones.]\n",
       "(5:50) [Visual: The TV screen shows the Apple TV audio menu for \"Josh Teder's AirPods Max\". Options for Spatial Audio (Off, Fixed, Head Tracked) and Spatialized Stereo (On/Off) are visible, along with Noise Control (Off, Transparency, Noise Cancellation).]\n",
       "(5:50) **Josh Teder:** Or have feature parity with AirPods for things like spatial audio and automatic device switching based on your iCloud account.\n",
       "(5:54) [Visual: The iPhone app screen shows the \"Services\" tab selected in the Sony Headphones Connect app. It lists \"Spotify Tap\", \"Amazon Music Play Now\", \"Endel Quick Access\", \"Auto Play (Beta)\", \"Ingress Prime\", \"Service Link\".]\n",
       "(5:58) [Visual: Tapping \"360 Reality Audio Setup\" brings up a setup screen.]\n",
       "(6:00) [Visual: The Services list is shown again.]\n",
       "(6:02) **Josh Teder:** Sony has tried to build features into these buds like 360 audio or a shortcut to Spotify and now Amazon Music, but I just don't think what Sony has built is as useful as what Apple and the other big tech companies are building into their ecosystems.\n",
       "(6:11) [Visual: Top-down shot of the open black Sony earbud case on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(6:11) **Josh Teder:** The other big downside I haven't talked about yet with these buds is you can't replace their battery.\n",
       "(6:17) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, holding the closed case.]\n",
       "(6:17) **Josh Teder:** Now, that's not unusual for earbuds at all, but given these cost about $300,\n",
       "(6:20) [Visual: The black Sony earbud case is on the right. The black Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are placed next to it on the left.]\n",
       "(6:21) **Josh Teder:** which is only $100 less than Sony's over-the-ear headphones, which do have a user-replaceable battery, mind you.\n",
       "(6:29) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting.]\n",
       "(6:29) **Josh Teder:** I really think if these companies tried and put a lot of their engineering talent to work, they could come up with a set of buds that had an easily replaceable battery by users, but also still carried a form of water resistance rating.\n",
       "(6:43) [Visual: Top-down shot of the open black Sony earbud case on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(6:44) [On-screen text appears: \"IPX4\"]\n",
       "(6:48) [Visual: Screenshot of a Sony product recycling website (eri-direct.com/sony). It shows fields for Manufacturer/Brand, Zip, and Product, with \"No products found\" displayed.]\n",
       "(6:48) **Josh Teder:** Sony doesn't have a trade-in or upgrade program for these buds, but does have a website that directs you where you can recycle their products, at least here in the US, and they do have a mail-in program here as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "(6:59) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting.]\n",
       "(6:59) **Josh Teder:** So that's everything I've liked and disliked about the Sony WF-1000XM5s. But I think the real question with these is, why would you go with the Sony buds over something like the AirPods Pro, the Galaxy Buds Pro 2, or even the Pixel Buds Pro?\n",
       "(7:13) [Visual: Josh holds up the black Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro case in his left hand and the white Apple AirPods Pro case in his right hand.]\n",
       "(7:14) [Visual: Top-down shot of the white AirPods Pro case, black Galaxy Buds 2 Pro case, black Sony WF-1000XM5 case, and white Pixel Buds Pro case lined up horizontally on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(7:14) **Josh Teder:** You want one of the best-sounding pairs of earbuds you can get for around $300. You want excellent, class-leading noise cancellation, good battery life, and you want a pair of buds that are comfortable that you can wear for hours, and that will stay put in your ear.\n",
       "(7:25) [Visual: Josh is back outside in the colorful LED structure.]\n",
       "(7:25) [On-screen graphic appears: Shopping cart icon, Arrow pointing down, \"LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION\"]\n",
       "(7:29) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting.]\n",
       "(7:30) **Josh Teder:** Otherwise, if you're an Apple user and you find the AirPods Pro comfortable, then I'd probably go with those.\n",
       "(7:36) [Visual: White retail box for Apple AirPods Pro.]\n",
       "(7:36) **Josh Teder:** They're cheaper and will get you better ecosystem features like multi-switching between devices, Dolby Atmos support, which also works with the Apple TV 4K.\n",
       "(7:40) [Visual: Hand picks up an AirPods Pro earbud from the case, showing the tip.]\n",
       "(7:41) [Visual: TV screen shows the Apple TV audio menu for \"Josh Teder's AirPods Max\", displaying Spatial Audio and Noise Control options.]\n",
       "(7:45) [Visual: The four earbud cases (AirPods Pro, Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, Sony XM5, Pixel Buds Pro) are lined up on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(7:45) **Josh Teder:** For Android, you don't have as many ecosystem reasons not to get the Sony's, but Samsung's first party buds now support Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio, which is not something the XM5s support via any device except pairing it with a Sony television.\n",
       "(7:49) [Visual: Screenshot of a Samsung website page titled \"What is the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro 360 audio feature & how to turn on\".]\n",
       "(7:58) [Visual: Top-down shot of the open black Sony earbud case.]\n",
       "(7:59) [Visual: The four earbud cases are lined up again on the wooden surface.]\n",
       "(7:59) **Josh Teder:** It's honestly a shame Apple, Google, and Samsung don't open up their ecosystem a bit more so other bud makers could offer these great features, but that's where we are in 2024.\n",
       "(8:05) [On-screen text appears below the cases: \"DO YOU AGREE? COMMENT BELOW\"]\n",
       "(8:11) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting, holding the closed Sony earbud case.]\n",
       "(8:11) **Josh Teder:** And if you want to see even more of my thoughts on these earbuds or you want to see my thoughts on other earbuds they compete with like the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2 or the Pixel Buds Pro, you should check out the videos I've done on all of these buds which you can get to by clicking here.\n",
       "(8:12) [Visual: Two thumbnail image overlays appear next to Josh. Left: Josh smiling and holding the open XM5 case. Text: \"Worth It?\". Right: Josh with headphones around his neck, looking confused/surprised. Text: \"Early Reviews Were Wrong\".]\n",
       "(8:28) [Visual: Josh is back in the office/desk setting. He gives a thumbs up sign.]\n",
       "(8:28) **Josh Teder:** And if you liked this video, don't forget to hit that thumbs up button below and subscribe to the channel for more.\n",
       "(8:28) [On-screen graphic appears: Thumbs up icon turns blue, Red subscribe button turns grey and says \"SUBSCRIBED!\".]\n",
       "(8:31) [Visual: Dark background with \"6 Months Later\" logo (red calendar with '6') and text \"6 Months Later\". Smaller text below says \"Reviews Comparisons Explainers\"]\n",
       "(8:34) **Josh Teder:** For 6 Months Later, I'm Josh Teder. Thanks for watching.\n",
       "(8:34) [Visual: White arrow graphic sweeps from left around the calendar logo, ending with \"SUBSCRIBE!\" text below.]\n",
