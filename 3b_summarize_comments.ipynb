       " \"I'm able to give you more specific feedback now:\\n\\nApt X Adaptive is great., I'm using it for the Bathys and also Sennheiser Momentum 4 TWS I just picked up.\\n\\nIt's an interesting codec because it can focus on quality, latency, or anywhere in between. As a result (and yes it's slightly more confusing), implementation can vary from hardware manufacturer to hardware manufacturer.\\n\\nI now have small BT 5.3/5.4 dongles from Creative, Avantree and Ugreen. They are all very good, but excel in slightly different things. Also, because I have the killswitch case on my Ally, certain dongles don't fit (namely the Creative, which I use for iPad / iPhone now).\\n\\nThe Creative, when connected to a computer, let's you flip the switch to prioritize Adaptive LL or Adaptive HQ. It has the best Adaptive HQ, and I use it most with say - an iPhone to be able to use the HQ Adaptive codecs with the Bathys.\\n\\nThe Ugreen allows you to switch between Adaptive LL and Adaptive HQ by pressing a button on the dongle while it's connected. These have the lowest latency signal of all dongles. I uses it with the Momentum TWS sometimes when I need the absolute lowest latency. However, it takes a little too much from quality for me, which appears noticeable on Bathys, not Momentum TWS, though. As context, I'm an audio nut and have headphones and speakers that are way too expensive (Utopia, Susvara, Abyss TC, Martin Logan, etc.) so, the audio may be fine for you. So, when I need the absolute lowest latency from the Bathy's, I'll just plug them in and use their USB-C dac.\\n\\nWith the Bathy's I am using the Avantree Dongle (Please note: They have a BT-81 Playstation (black) and BT-81 PC (White), you want thje Playstation/Black one for gaming on any type of device. The white one is only for Zoom/Teams type calls on PC). This dongle is in low latency mode by default, and while it's literally milliseconds slower that the Ugreen, it sounds much better with the Bathys. While both the Ugreen and Avantree fit the Ally with the Killswitch, this is smallest and most convenient - because you don't need to change LL vs HQ prioritization. I use this most of the time with both headphones for gaming. Latency is very, very, slight - you need to concentrate on the sound in order to be able to notice anything at all - and sound quality is great. This is my goto for everything, and I think the latency vs quality profile is perfect for a handheld. Ease of use is top notch, since both headphones are pre-paired, you just plug in boot up, and you are connected like a dongle.\\n\\nI went with these headphones rather than dedicated gaming headphones or earbuds with a dongle because music playaback is very important to me as well. Fortunately, with each, Apt X adaptive is quite good for both.\",\n",

       " 'Have been using my personal pair of bathys for a few weeks now since I got a good deal on a used pair after trying a friends pair and yea, they blow just about every other ANC wireless pair out the water. Rn, AirPods Max on Amazon are 470$ US. since the new bathys came out the original is 560$ US. still a very expensive headphone, but definitely better than anything cheaper, or even things more expensive since I prefer them to the 5909, and PX8. If you care about sound quality over features and ANC just get the bathys. Not even saying their ANC or features are bad, they’re good. But the sound quality from the AirPods to the bathys really is a huge step down, Bathys just sound so natural and open. Like I know those sound like dumb YouTube review words, but if you get the chance to try both pairs you’ll know what I’m talking about right away. ',\n",
       " 'If you’re looking for ANC headphones to use while traveling, then prioritize ANC quality as it will have the biggest impact on your listening experience. \\n\\nWhat good is beautiful, open soundstage and clarity when plane engines are roaring 10 meters from your face and the ANC isn’t able to block it out properly.\\n\\nSony and Bose are simply the absolute best options for ANC, at the price. The QC-35II are $200. The Sony XM4 are $215. Good luck finding better value than that.\\n\\nNot to say the Bathys don’t have a place, and considering them superior to Airpods Max is wrong, but if ANC headphones is why you’re considering either, widen your aperture of options and make a smart purchase.',\n",
       " \"Not identical, but close enough for me and exactly what I wanted. Immediate improvement over the K371 despite the (to me, mild) differences. There's a 5 kHz dip in the Azurys relative to the K371. And then there's a 3.7 kHz bump in the Azurys where the K371 has a dip, though no one complains about the latter anyway. Nothing sounds offputtingly different in the Azurys. It is very much the opposite. If you felt there was congestion and glare in the upper mids on the K371, especially in busy tracks, kiss that goodbye. The imaging and tuning is that good.\\n\\nAnd coming from the K371, I think the bass on the Azurys will be everything you wanted the K371 it to be. The quantity is still there, but it is so much more distinct, textured and spatially larger relative to the K371. In terms of other soundstage qualities, the Azurys to me makes the K371 sound like an IEM. \\n\\nAlso, PSA, the Lensys is not a black Azurys like people on other forums are saying. They're not on entirely different planets, but they have different tunings for sure. I have them both sitting here. I wish they were the same. I wanted so badly to have an Azurys that wasn't a stain magnet. The Lensys seems like it has more energy in the upper mids/lower treble with a brilliance spike that is ehhhhh. For the type of music I listen to, they will be fatiguing. There's also better upper bass/lower mids width and imaging I feel on the Azurys, and it doesn't seem to be an effect of tuning differences. If you're a person who found the Azurys veiled, you will most likely love the Lensys. It's a well done studio headphone and I would absolutely choose it to produce and even master over other headphones. But for everyday listening, fatiguing\",\n",

       " 'Honest review of the Bathys (latest firmware for November 2023). I have mixed feelings about these.\\r\\n\\nIt costs more than other wired Focals, which sound better. It costs more than Sony XM5, which has much better ANC, and sounds 70% as good (with an AutoEQ preset). XM5 is better for travelling. Wired Focals are better indoors. So where does Bathys fit in? I guess convenience is the main strong point. An easy headphone to use, in a noisy office or house. \\n\\r\\nThe Good:\\r\\n\\n- It\\'s a portable, ANC Focal headphone! More convenient than a DAC/amp setup, and no closed-back \"rumble\" on your head, thanks to ANC. \\r\\n- Great sound quality for an ANC headphone. It\\'s punchy, airy, dynamic, with good soundstage. Realistic timbre. Instruments are separated well. Vocals are clear and intimate, \"pulled forward\".\\r\\n- Sounds better than Sony XM5, in every way. But wired Focals are still better.\\r\\n- Acceptable ANC. It\\'s behind the Sony XM5, but good enough to enjoy music outdoors.\\n- Comfortable. Nicer to wear than XM5, for long periods. The drivers don\\'t touch my ears. Clamp force was an issue, but it\\'s better now. \\r\\n- Nice range of inputs - Bluetooth (good), USB (slightly better) - Or 3.5mm jack (MUCH better on a DAC/amp. Better dynamic range, and noise floor).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bad:\\r\\n\\r\\n- LOUD noise floor. In a quiet room, the white noise is terrible. Almost ruins the music - I turn the volume too high because of it. Which causes ear fatigue. Sony XM5 has zero noise.\\r\\n- It sounds compressed, and treble is dirty (thanks to AptX codec). It sounds up-front and strong, with less dynamic range. 3.5mm jack sounds better, and more nuanced. It needs LDAC.\\n  - The compression makes it sound \"good\", because loudness does that. But it fatigues the ears VERY quickly (loudness = fatigue). And it isn\\'t accurate to the mix. Compared with wired headphones, I can instantly hear the Bathys compression. Not good. \\r\\n- Fatiguing. As I said above. But Focals are punchy, and hit pretty hard. Bathys is even more fatiguing than the Utopia. Especially the treble peaks. \\r\\n- Too unforgiving with tracks. Like most Focals, it makes the flaws in a mix sound 10x worse. Not because it\\'s a \"good headphone\" - Many flagship headphones are forgiving, like the LCD-5 and HE1000se. Focal does something weird, where it \"blows up\" every nuance. It makes flaws sound terrible and harsh.\\r\\n- This makes it hard to EQ. If a song isn\\'t mixed properly, the EQ sounds wrong. There\\'s no \\'sweet spot\\' where it always sounds good. Again, only Focals have this issue for me.\\r\\n- The right earcup makes a whining noise, if the LED is on full brightness. 50% brightness is fine.\\r\\n- Awkward to take out and put away. It takes about 1 minute for the whole \"process\", from opening the case to pairing, and hearing music. The XM5 takes 5 seconds. XM5 is MUCH more portable.\\r\\n- The buttons are awful. It\\'s awkward to use. Poorly designed button layout. Especially the power/DAC switch. Pushing the switch feels like I\\'m about to snap the yokes.\\r\\n- Terrible volume control in DAC mode. It goes from \"loud enough\" to \"too loud\" quickly. Not enough adjustment range.',\n",

You have an interesting description there for the Elex, one that I think I can agree on. It\\'s not wholly closed in like the HD600, but it\\'s not very wide either. The Hadenys is definitely close to the HD600 style staging.\\n\\n> I would like to sell the Elex to buy the Hadenys if they deliver a similar quality with a bit more visceral bass.

       "[\"I recently took my AirPod Pros into a Tokyo headphone shop and got a chance to try a Mark Levinson and a Focal Bathys.  I am a professional double bass player.  I play a lot of acoustic music but listen to all kinds of music on any given day.  I listened to my AirPod Pros all the way to the shop.  I was so excited to put the Bathys on and be blown away.  But I have to say, I was shocked that I didn't find them better than my AirPod Pros.  i know I know, that is very controversial.  I did find that the Bathys were better at bringing all the instruments into a clear comprehensive sound.  I could hear a secondary guitar track on Radiohead's Weird Fishes in addition to an organ I never heard.  That is exciting.  When I put the AirPod Pros back on I did miss some of that clarity.  I could hear those details that i heard in the Focal but not as clearly defined and not as pronounced.  But here's the deal.  I felt more moved by the music, more like I was in a beautiful sound space, more immersive, more engaging.  I kept comparing tracks from all different kinds of recording but I just could not justify buying a pair of Bathys.  Yes, they would be an interesting addition to my headphone collection, but not enough to drop the cash.  I walked out even more impressed with my $200 AirPod Pros.  I did try the Levinson but did not find them that interesting and also i could easily max out the volume with my iphone which was a deal breaker before even starting.  So there you go. Spicy take, I know.  Now I can't wait to get back to the States to try my Maxwells again.  I do remember thinking they were significantly better than my AirPod Pros but now I am curious.  I haven't been using the Maxwells that much because I find them prohibitively big!  I didn't take them on tour this time because I simply didn't have the room to pack them.  Still looking for a significant over-ear bluetooth headphone to augment my AirPod Pros.  The search continues.\",\n",
       " \"First off if you're looking for a pair of Bluetooth Headphones to rock your world with a lot of bass these aren't the headphones for you.  In other words they aren't Beats headphones.  They have adequate bass using the EQ in the Focal App (Focal & Naim).  I had to do a deep search in the App Store and the reason why I'm giving you the name of the app.  Evidentially this app is used for the speakers they sell as well as their headphones.  The app has a low rating which I don't understand why because it has worked flawlessly so don't let the low rating influence you.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to discuss the sound.  These are the 4th pair of BT headphones I own.  Crazy I know.  I started with the BOSE NC700  and they were great.  I then picked up the Senneheiser Momentum 4 that possessed more dynamics.  Then I bought the BOSE Quiet Comfort Ultras and finally the Focal Bathys.  These are frigging expensive and probably why I'm the first to right a review.  I bought the BOSE Quiet Comfort Ultras because the immersive audio sounded great.  Through the magic of DSP they create a larger virtual sound stage but that comes with a minor distortion and when I say minor only a picky person would notice it.  I differ with your opinion regarding the sound stage.  The Focal Bathys have a wide sound stage without using DSP circuitry.  Not sure how they do but they do it without creating any distortion.  The clarity of the music through these headphones is spectacular revealing subtle nuances in the songs I've never heard before.  The sound stage that I refer to is how wide the music is presented to your ears.  Image a 2D vs and 3D picture.  It's like listening to music in another dimension.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe look of these headphones is eye catching too kinda like using an Apple product.  Will I use these when I'm cutting the grass probably not, no definitely not but inside the house or on trips. The comfort is great too.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo if you are on the hunt like me for the best sound in BT headphones and you have the budget for these you can't wrong with Focal Baths.\",\n",
       " \"I tried PX8 in a store and was very impressed. Yes they have too much deep bass, but the midrange and treble is extremely good for bluetooth headphones. Very clean, smooth, open and undistorted. Other reviewers have praised how female vocals sound, which I didn't think much of until I heard the PX8 myself. When I tried listening to Iri I was taken aback by how good her voice sounded. The frequency balance could be better, but every other aspect of the sound impressed me, being a clear tier above headphones like Bose QC Ultra (which I compared against directly). For example, the QC Ultra sounded hard and tonally grey in music like Judas Priest Painkiller. The PX8 more than justified their price difference in pure audio quality in that song. I'm not buying them because bluetooth headphones feel disposable in a way wired headphones aren't. But I came back to this review after hearing the headphones myself and I think more subjectivity would improve the channel. Given of course that you have the hearing and ability to describe it in a relatable manner.\",\n",
       " 'That’s hard to say. These have a more relaxed sound, so if you’re looking for a lot of excitement, I’m not sure this isn’t. (Of note: while I listen to a lot of electronic music, I don’t listen to a ton of techno, so please keep this in mind.) \\n\\nOf these three: \\n- Bathys: very relaxed sound, great for low level detail. I’m a big fan of this for acoustic music \\n- Momentum 4: more exciting sound, very clear yet bass heavy, but less mature. (In fact, I have a Momentum 4 vs Bathys video, if you want to watch that.) \\n- Px8: VERY bass heavy and dark. I’m not in love with what it does to the timbre, but it’s does have an excellent sound. \\n\\nOf these, I think the M4 is worth the try for you, but the low level detail and maturity of the sound might pull you to one of the others. \\n\\nFinally, given that you’re all-in on Apple… what about the AirPods Max? Very different sound from these, but I’ve generally enjoyed it. I know a lot of people dislike it, but I think it’s because of how much processing happens in the background and how it can sound very different for people. It’s not as full of a sound as any of the above, but in your case, I think it’s worth considering.  \\n\\nHope this helps.',\n",
       " 'I’m 62 and my ears at higher registers? Not so good. \\n\\nThe Focal app tested my hearing and boosted frequencies on the Bathys where I have difficulty hearing. Im so happy that it improved my listening experience.',\n",
       " 'I don’t think you can expect the best in class tech integration.. this is their first pair of Bluetooth headphones, Sony and Apple have more people working on this that the whole of Focal! I love my Bathys, I rarely use my other headphones now, looks, sound comfort the Bathys has it all!!',\n",
       " \"I'm very happy with my Bathys. I have a bit of high frequency hearing loss, so the app's hearing test and Sound Personalization (based on the hearing test results) make this a truly unique product and my favorite headphone by far. I think the hiss you complained about in transparent mode is just the Bathys amplifying the ambient noise. This is what this mode is intended to do. If your Bathys lacks the Sound Personalization feature, you need to update the firmware and Focal app. I agree you get the best sound with DAC mode. However, if your Bluetooth transmitter supports aptX Adaptive, you may be happy with using the Bathys wireless only. A great match for the Bathys is the new iFi Zen Blue 3 High-res bluetooth transmitter/receiver.\",\n",
       " 'Good question, and thanks for asking. \\n\\nFirst: if you’re getting headphones for music production, don’t get these. Get something with a more detailed, flatter signature. These change the sound too much and will impact your mix. I recommend something like the Sennheiser HD 560S, which are also good for gaming. \\n\\nAs for what I mean: the imaging on these — how good they are at positioning the sound so that you can tell where it’s coming from — isn’t the best on these. Those are important for games. Aldi, they are very warm, which makes them great for long listening sessions, but will lose detail that’s important for both games and movies/shows. With those, you also want something that give you a lot of emphasized clarity in the high treble and low bass, which these lack, at least in the proportions you want for movies and games. \\n\\nSo recommendations: \\n- for production and gaming, consider the Sennheiser HD 560S. https://amzn.to/3wHJ1vI\\n- then get the Sennheiser Momentum 4 fur music and TV. (They’re also decent for games.) https://amzn.to/3K9cUIz\\n\\nThat combination will cost you about the same as the Bathys, but will give you the flexibility you want. (Linked to Amazon so you can price compare, but in USD, the combo comes out to $480. Even at full price, they come out at $649, which is cheaper than the Bathys and good for your needs.) \\n\\nI did a comparison of the Bathys and Momentum 4 here, by the way, in case you’re interested. https://youtu.be/9xgFyJrHeWY\\n\\nBest of luck!',\n",

Ask away in case it helps with your Bathys decision in any way:\\nThe sound quality winner: The Momentum 4 even with APTX ( thus missing AptxHD/Aptx lossless for now).\\nThe Anc winner: the XM5 and Airpods. \\nThe biggest waste: The Drop Panda. \\nThe shallowness earcups: The Xm5. \\nThe quickest degrading/dirt gathering case : the XM5. \\nThe lightest : Xm5. \\nThe most premium feeling but heaviest: Airpods Max. \\nThe second most premium feeling: Momentum 4 \\nThe highest bitrate codec stably streaming: The Xm5 with LDAC manually set to 990Kbps. \\nThe battery that already died in less than a year with no company support: The Pandas. \\nThe best imaging Momentum 4. \\nThe most natural timbre: The momentum4\\nThe softest most comfortable best sealing earpads: The Momentum 4.\\nThe most breathable feeling/lowest heat: The Airpods Max\\nThe best transparency mode: The airpods max.\\nBest background noise cancelling in the mics so that others hear my voice easily: The Xm5 and Airpods Max\\nThe goofiest still can't answer a call all the time: Momentum 4 but it's probably my own user error haha\\nThe one I reach for the most: Momentum 4. Something about the sound and those soft plush earpads\\nThe one whose sound quality will improve a lot if you have the new 2023 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 plus chip that supports the new Aptx Lossless codec such as the 2022 Asus Rog 6 or any flagship android in 2023: Momentum 4 and Focal Bathys\\nWhat sounds better: Almost any wired headset over $300 if you even have a cheap dac Amp such as the bang for buck dual dac Fiio Btr5 or 7\\nBathys vs Momentum 4 sound quality over Bluetooth on the same codec: DMS noted the Bathys is way better than the airpods max. I conclude it sounds better than the Momentum 4 (Ignoring price differences)\\nThe bass winner: Sony Xm5 and Sennheiser Momentum 4\\nThe clearest sounding withiut siblance or eq: Momentum 4 even with only Aptx (not Aptx lossless or Aptx HD enabled) and Airpods Max even though it's AAC\\nThe easiest to lock in the highest bandwidth codec: Sony Xm5 since you can EASILY TURN ON DEVELOPER OPTIONS and lock LDAC 990Kbps as long as your device can push it without stuttering. HINT TURN OFF POWER SAVING AND turn on overdrive if you have it on your android.\\n\\nP.s. For reference on sound conclusions above here are my wired cans: I have an HE1000SE, HD800, Clear with a D90 A90 stack so I am knee deep in the addiction/hobby.\",\n",
       " '@@NorbReviews I got the bathys and returned the same day…the standing bass and chello ranges just don’t come through on train’s ‘play that song’ repeating bridge…that leaves them sounding lifeless and clinical, even with the eq in the app boosted…and same story with the highs…they’re basically the total opposite of bose since bose tend to drop mid ranges and highlight the lows and highs…also what is with the constant anc hiss which can’t be turned off?…you only have 3 choices: alot of hiss and 2 levels of almost as much hiss!…at least the momentum4s can be mostly set to anc off(though I wish it were dead simple to just turn off anc)…I didn’t even bother trying usb dac mode bc what would be the point with all that hiss and poor range?…they were very comfortable but I was super disappointed…definitely not $650 sounding headphones to me…the momentum 4s when eq adjusted blow the bathys away in sound and anc hiss',\n",

I had the opportunity to extensively listen to the Bathys and Px8.  The Bathys are excellent as you suggest.  They have a wider sound stage.  BUT, the Px8, to my ears sounded better, with a warmth and intimacy missing in the Bathys.  I have not heard the ML, but I wouldn't actually be willing to spend $1,000, so it would be academic at best.  I have to wonder if the pair of Px8 you received had some issue with them?  Or, if 11 months later, B&W has updated them to be more in line with the Bathys?  Either way, for my money, I simply couldn't be happier with the Px8.  Everyone's ears are different, of course.  Mine chose the Px8 and I'm very very happy they did!\\n\\nI just received the Px8 on Friday.

And back to SOUND, those two sound \"weak\" on too many mainstream music, so the preference in this video doesn\\'t necessarily apply to those music. THAT explains why many consumers that do NOT rely on these BS graphs and actually focus on MUSIC, prefer PX8, and nothing is wrong with that. That the type of music you listen to determines which is the best headphone, not the Harman curve, should be highlighted in comparisons like this. Unfortunately, too many fanatic viewers take the reviewer\\'s word for it and all too easily makes terrible buying mistakes.',\n",

But for a most people, it’s a 50/50 proposition: they’re looking for something they can use for outside the house (wireless + ANC) AND at home (good sound quality). And people love their wireless tech, which means wired headphones will usually take a back seat, no matter how much better they sound. (Within reason.) Plus, if you want one thing for all situations—as most people do because why get tools to do the same thing—you’re gonna go with the most flexible option.
